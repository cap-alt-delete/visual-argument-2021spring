**Accessibility Tips Relevant to Visual Rhetoric** 

(The following information is a compilation of notes taken from online research. The websites where the information was found are listed below and are not my original work. I simply wanted to gather relevant notes in one place for educational purposes.)

**1. WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - June 2010)** - offers guidelines for increasing digital accessibility (designed for web pages, but has useful general tips that can be applied to other forms of digital contect)

- website: https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/ (below are some highlights relevant to visual media)
    - editors: Ben Caldwell, Trace R&D Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison / Michael Cooper, W3C / Loretta Guarino Reid, Google, Inc. / Gregg Vanderheiden, Trace R&D Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison
- create text alternatives for any non-text content (ex. include text-based descriptions in the meta-data of the image)
    -  doing so allows the text to be altered to the user's specific needs (ex. speech, different language, larger text, etc.)
- use contrast with coloring of text
    - Level AA is 4.5:1 for smaller text and 3:1 for larger text
    - Level AAA is 7:1 for smaller text and 4.5:1 for larger text (greater accessibility)
    - https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ allows you to check your color palette contrast for levels AA and AAA
- width of < 80 characters with non-justified text and line-spacing of at least 1.5 for any long text
- images of text should only be used for pure decoration or when given presentation if necessary to the information being conveyed

**2. British Dyslexia Association (2018)** - offers guidelines on styling to increase text readability for those with dyslexia 

- website: https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide#:~:text=Readable%20fonts,may%20request%20a%20larger%20font. (below are some highlights relevant to visual media)
- sans serif fonts such as Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Century Gothic, Trebuchet, Calibri, and Open Sans are more readable
- minimum font size of 12-14 points, although larger can be more helpful
- use bold over italics or underline for emphasis
- avoid fonts that use capital/uppercase with small caps for lower case
- increase contrast between background and text
    - if possible, make the background light and the text dark

**3. Venngage Article "How to Use Color Blind Friendly Palettes to Make Your Charts Accessible" by Rachel Cravit (08/21/2019)** - offers color scheme tips, along with some color-blind safe color palettes

- website: https://venngage.com/blog/color-blind-friendly-palette/ (below are some highlights relevant to visual media)
- avoid color combinations that will make color differentiation difficult
    - red/green, green/brown, green/blue, blue/gray, blue/purple, green/gray, green/black
- use greater contrast and patterns/textures to make differentiation easier
- you can also opt for a monochromatic color scheme that relies solely on contrast for differentiation 
- symbols/icons can help to clarify things normally shown through color-coding
