*Title:* "Inclusive Design is **just** design."

*Introduction:* Designers, through their design choices, decide who is able to interact with their creations. Due to the fact that our environments are now largely composed of designed objects (everything from buildings to phones to posters), designers ultimately get the final say in whether or not people can interact with their environments. Subsequently, there is a need to make sure designers consider the full range of abilities in their target demographic, so that their designs are accessible. However, design practices in the past for people with differing ability levels has often been paternalistic. Designers would make assumptions about disability and design based on those assumptions alone, creating products that don't really meet the needs of their users.

In contrast, Laurenellen McCann emphasizes the approach of "designing with, not for" and including the target audience in the process. This is the approach I am advocating for with this project. The users know best what will make the design, and consequently their environment, accessible. Ultimately, inclusive design is not about being charitable. It's about giving people fair access to the world around them.
