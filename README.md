*Working Title:* "Inclusive Design is **just** design."

*Proposal:* For my visual rhetoric project, I would like to focus on the importance of inclusive design/design that meets disability. Specifically, I want to argue against paternalistic design that makes broad-brush assumptions about users with disability and instead emphasize the approach of “designing with, not for” (a phrase attributed to Laurenellen McCann). Given that designers are the people who, through their design choices, decide whether users can access an environment in the end, I think it’s extremely important that they consider the full range of abilities in their user demographic and ask how they can make their designs accessible.
