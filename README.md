*Working Title:* "Inclusive Design is **just** design."

*Proposal:* For my visual rhetoric project, I would like to focus on the importance of inclusive design/design that meets disability. Specifically, I want to argue against paternalistic design that makes broad-brush assumptions about users with disability and instead emphasize the approach of “designing with, not for” (a phrase attributed to Laurenellen McCann). Given that designers are the people who, through their design choices, decide whether users can access an environment in the end, I think it’s extremely important that they consider the full range of abilities in their user demographic and ask how they can make their designs accessible.

*Repository Navigation:*

- The assignment prompt (assignment.md), in-class-exercise folder, and .gitignore/.gitattributes files can be found in the initial-assignment folder
- A screenshot, text description, and exported .png file for the 3/2 preview can be found in the visual-preview folder
- The assets.md file and main photoshop file (visual-rhetoric.psd) can both be found in the main repository, along with a file of notes on inclusive visual design (accessibility-tips.md)
